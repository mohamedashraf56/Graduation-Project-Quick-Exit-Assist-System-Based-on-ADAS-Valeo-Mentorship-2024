#### Embedded System for Quick Exit Assist System and Car Collision Avoidance

This Part focuses on the embedded system part of our graduation project, which aims to achieve car collision avoidance using Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication. Additionally,
## the core of the project involves the development of a Quick Exit Assist System designed specifically for rollover and drowning accidents.

Within this partion, you will find the necessary files and code related to the embedded system implementation, including communication protocols, sensor integration, decision-making algorithms, and system architecture.

Our goal is to enhance vehicle safety by leveraging V2V communication for proactive collision avoidance and providing a reliable Quick Exit Assist System for critical accidents. We are grateful for the support and guidance from our mentor as we work towards achieving these objectives.

Please note that this repository primarily focuses on the embedded system aspects of the project. For other components or functionalities, additional repositories or files may be available.

Thank you for your interest and support as we strive to make significant advancements in automotive safety.
