## AI Object Detection 

This Partion contains the files and code related to the AI-based object detection components of our graduation project on Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) using Embedded Linux, with support from Valeo. These components aim to enhance vehicle safety by detecting objects. Feel free to explore the repository for the specific files and code related to these functionalities.

#### 1- Pre-Trained Model

# we began by utilizing a pre-trained YOLOv8 Nano model trained on the COCO dataset. 

# This initial pre-training phase gave our model a broad understanding of various object categories and real-world image variations. To tailor its knowledge to our specific application domain, we fine-tuned the model, ensuring optimal performance and accuracy.
